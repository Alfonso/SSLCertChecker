# SSLCertChecker
## What is this?
This script is a simple SSL Certificate checker. Due to issues that individuals and companies face of SSL certs becoming invalid, or have other issues, having a script that checks the validity of the certs is imperative. Checking each of the individual sites that are provided, the script checks if the SSL cert is valid, and if it is whether or not it is within a certain time frame. If it within the time frame or invalid, an email is sent to the desired email.
